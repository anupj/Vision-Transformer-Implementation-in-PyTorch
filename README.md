# Vision-Transformer-Implementation-in-PyTorch
This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of the Vision Transformer (ViT), inspired by the seminal paper "An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale". The project builds a Vision Transformer model from scratch, processes images into patches, and trains the model on standard image datasets.
